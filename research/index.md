My expertise and interests lie in the fields of:
* Mesoscopic physics and quantum transport
* Disordered systems
* Strongly-correlated systems
* Topological phases of light and matter

The following is a brief description of the subjects I have been interested in over the years, as well as a corresponding list of relevant analytical methods and numerical techniques. 

### Oscillations of rapidly rotating stars

[Asteroseismology](http://www.nature.com/news/kepler-s-surprise-the-sounds-of-the-stars-1.9724) aims at inferring internal properties of stars from the analysis of their oscillation mode frequencies. 
This process can be greatly simplified when a theoretical prediction for the basic structure of the oscillation spectrum is available. 
Such is the case for stars which are (almost) spherically symmetric, e.g. [the Sun](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/bestofsoho.html), where the asymptotic (i.e. high-frequency) structure of the pressure-mode spectrum is well known.
However, most intermediate-mass and massive stars are [rapidly rotating on their axes](http://dept.astro.lsa.umich.edu/~monnier/Altair2007/altair2007.html), such that spherical symmetry is broken by the effect of the centrifugal force.
For those rapidly rotating stars, an adequate asymptotic theory of oscillation modes was thus missing. 

By studying the asymptotic regime of pressure waves with the tools of [quantum chaos](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-chaos-subatomic-worlds/), we were able to show that the oscillation spectrum 
of these stars is a superposition of different 'integrable' (regular) and 'chaotic' (irregular) sub-spectra. 
Most importantly for asteroseismology, we obtained semi-analytical formulas that predict the values of regular frequency spacings in the 'integrable' spectrum, which can provide constraints on physical properties of rapidly rotating stars which are observed.
