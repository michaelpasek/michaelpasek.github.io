My expertise and interests lie in the fields of:
* Mesoscopic physics and quantum transport
* Disordered systems
* Strongly-correlated systems
* Topological phases

Below is a brief description of some specific problems that I have been interested in. 

#### Oscillations of stars that are deformed by their own rotation

Asteroseismology is a technique from the field of Astrophysics that aims at inferring the internal properties of stars from the monitoring of their surface oscillations.
These ``starquakes'', just like earthquakes here on Earth, are due to waves propagating below the surface, in their complex interior.
Properties of these surface oscillations can be measured from high-precision Earth-based or space-based observatories, the [Kepler space telescope](http://www.nature.com/news/kepler-s-surprise-the-sounds-of-the-stars-1.9724) being one recent example.

From the measured oscillation frequencies, useful predictions on the stellar interior can be drawn provided one has some a priori knowledge on the basic structure of the oscillation spectrum. 
For stars which are almost spherical, such as our closest star [the Sun](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/bestofsoho.html), the spatial and spectral structure of surface oscillations is well known, which allowed astrophysicists to make [detailed predictions](http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.74.1073) on the properties of their interior.
However, contrary to the Sun, most stars rotate rapidly on their axes, which makes them strongly depart from spherical symmetry. 
As a consequence, the basic structure of their oscillation spectrum could not be obtained from the standard theoretical framework of asteroseismology.

By studying the oscillations in a generic stellar model deformed by rotation through high-accuracy numerical simulations, and using the theoretical framework of [quantum chaos](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-chaos-subatomic-worlds/) to interpret these results, we were able to show that the oscillation spectrum of rotating stars is a superposition of many different regular and irregular sub-spectra. 
Most importantly for asteroseismology, we managed to derive a mathematical formula satisfied by some frequency spacings in the regular spectrum. 
If these spacings are identified in observed spectra, it can indeed provide important constraints on the internal physical properties of rotating stars.
Eventually, this should allow astrophysicists to test further the theories of stellar structure and evolution for massive stars that rotate rapidly.

#### Floquet topological insulator phases in network models

<!--- A recently proposed class of topological photonic systems is shown to map onto the Chalker-
Coddington network model, which was originally formulated to study disordered quantum Hall
systems. Formally, stationary states of network models are equivalent to the Floquet states of a
periodically driven lattice. We show that such network models can indeed exhibit topologically
protected edge states even if all bands have zero Chern number, which is a characteristic property
of Floquet band structures. 1 .
We also report on the measurement of a topological
invariant in a (microwave) photonic implementation of
the network model. Here the topological edge inva-
riant is directly accessible through the winding number
of the complex reflection coefficients. The experiment
can be regarded as a variant of a topological pump, with
nonzero winding in the reflection matrix implying the
existence of topological edge states. 2 .

lues having winding numbers +/-1 corresponds to
the bulk band structure being topologically non-
trivial. --->
