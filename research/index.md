My expertise and interests lie in the fields of:
* Mesoscopic physics and quantum transport
* Disordered systems
* Strongly-correlated systems
* Topological phases

Below is a brief description of some specific problems that I have been interested in. 

#### Oscillations of stars that are deformed by their own rotation

Asteroseismology is a technique from the field of Astrophysics that aims at inferring the internal properties of stars from the monitoring of their surface oscillations (one may call them ``starquakes'' by analogy with earthquakes here on Earth).
Properties of these surface oscillations, such as their frequencies, can be measured from high-precision Earth-based or space-based observatories, the [Kepler](http://www.nature.com/news/kepler-s-surprise-the-sounds-of-the-stars-1.9724) space mission being one example.

To deduce useful predictions on the stellar interior from the measured oscillation frequencies, one needs however to have some theoretical a priori knowledge of the basic structure of the oscillation spectrum. 
For stars which are almost spherical, such as our closest star [the Sun](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/gallery/bestofsoho.html), the spatial and spectral structure of surface oscillations is well known, which allowed astrophysicists to make very detailed predictions on their interior.
However, for most stars, in particular those that are more massive than the Sun, the fact that they rotate rapidly on their axes makes them strongly depart from spherical symmetry, and the basic structure of their spectrum could not be obtained with traditional methods of asteroseismology.

By studying the oscillations of some generic model of a rapidly rotating star through high-accuracy numerical simulations and using the theoretical framework of [quantum chaos](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-chaos-subatomic-worlds/) to interpret those results, we were able to show that the oscillation spectrum of massive stars is a superposition of many different regular and irregular sub-spectra. 
Most importantly for asteroseismology of such massive stars, we managed to predict the values of some frequency spacings in the regular spectrum, which can provide important constraints on their internal physical properties.
