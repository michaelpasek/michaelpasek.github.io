### A Brief Description

I am a theoretical physicist, working as a post-doctoral researcher in the group of [Antoine Georges](https://www.cpht.polytechnique.fr/cpht/correl/mainpage.htm) at [Collège de France](http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/physique-matiere-condensee/index.htm) 
and [Centre de Physique Théorique](https://www.cpht.polytechnique.fr/) in Ecole Polytechnique.

My current research interests include ultracold atomic gases in disordered potentials, topological phases, and unconventional superfluidity in low-dimensional Fermi gases.
